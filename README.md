# legend_creator
This AutoLISP routine automatically inserts legend blocks based on the selection set and mapping of the objects and the legend blocks. User selects the objects they want to be displayed in the legend. The objects that have not mapped to a legend block are ignored. The routine also takes into account that blocks may have different visibility states that have a different legend entry.
